let name='ansbd';
name = 12; we can asign number

Object types: pass by address
Arrays; Contains list of items 
Functions;

** : x**y (x raised to y)
Post increment: a++; (used the values and increment values)
===: Strict equality [matches data type and values both]
==: loose equality
!==: Not equal

OR: || Operators
(false || 5 || 1)=> 5 (one true value then will not check for other values)

Operator Precedence:


**Factory Functions**
**Constructor functions

------this & new Keyword-----------
this : refer current Object
new: create empty Object
empty objected created by new keyword referred by this

a.draw(): a- object

Dynamic nature of the object:
we can add new properties to the object
we can delete properties from the object

Functions are objects

**Primitive are copied by their values**
**Refernces are copied by their addresses
